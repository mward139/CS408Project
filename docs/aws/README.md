# AWS EC2 Launch Guide

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Due to security and cost considerations, you will be provided with a fully configured EC2 instance for the course. If are curious about how to launch and configure an EC2 instance on your own, the instructions below detail the process to create an EC2 instance that matches the one provided for the course.

> [!WARNING]
>Launching and using AWS services can incur costs if not done carefully. Always make sure to monitor your AWS usage and understand the pricing of the services you are using.
